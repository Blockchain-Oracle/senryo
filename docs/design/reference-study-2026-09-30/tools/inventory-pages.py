INTRO='''# Feature inventory — what each recording actually contains

[Study index](README.md) · [Logos and identity](08-logos-and-identity.md) · [Redesign opportunities](10-redesign-opportunities.md) · [Machine-readable feature inventory](feature-inventory.json)

This register contains **__COUNT__ feature and behavior entries**, including the requested password/passkey topics as explicit gaps. It inventories everything identified in these recorded sessions; it cannot claim every feature in the full apps. UI cards, actual payment cards, marketing illustrations and functioning product features are distinguished.

**Capture status:** Observed behavior = an action/state transition is visible; Visible affordance = control/content exists but its result is not demonstrated; Advertised or illustrated = benefit or tutorial content; Started/outcome incomplete = entered flow stops before completion; Not captured = no direct ceremony/outcome exists in these recordings.

**Target treatment:** Existing-plan journey means the interaction/presentation can enrich an already specified Senryo journey, not that the competitor's whole product feature or current implementation is present. Candidate product addition means an idea for a product decision. Product decision required means support, integration or scope cannot be inherited. Reference-specific means policy, limits or claims belong to the recorded app. These labels do not claim implementation or live acceptance.

## Senryo boundaries checked before proposing add-ons

The [current product plan](../../plan/00-plan.md) already specifies passkey account creation/returning sign-in, biometrics, trading/leverage/risk, trigger SL/TP, watchlists, alerts, deposits/withdrawals, card flows, recovery and execution status. Treat better visual/interaction handling as **polish of planned journeys**, not newly invented features.

D-041 specifies Mera signing, external funding by QR/address, a separate Monad deposit family and **no fiat on-ramp at launch**. Apple/Google account login, wallet connectors, Apple Pay purchases, debit on-ramps and every competitor chain are not silently added. D-029 defines passkey create/returning behavior. D-037 refines the earlier Face ID defaults by mode/threshold; do not implement a stale earlier default. Senryo's planned 500 ms hold confirmation remains authoritative rather than adopting Fomo's unproven slider success.

Usernames, social follows, clans, trader feeds, referral mechanics and prediction markets are **candidate product changes** here. They need full happy/failure/empty/loading/recovery journeys and actual data before they can become capabilities. Advertising a card/yield/reward benefit is not proof of issuance, spending, staking or payout.

OUTRO='''## Coverage checks for an implementing agent

Pick an end-to-end journey and all its feature IDs before choosing components. Map those IDs to the [44 component briefs](05-components-and-agent-handoff.md), identity requirements and motion IDs. A feature that depends on another route must carry its parent restoration, field retention, consent, keyboard, data-loading and error states with it.

The recording proves a selected set of interface behavior. A complete target journey still needs actual creation/sign-in, successful funds credit, validated order/settlement, completed SL/TP, position management, card lifecycle and secure recovery. Use [capture gaps](06-capture-gaps.md) to separate missing reference fidelity from target product acceptance. Never fabricate a successful receipt from the recorded zero-balance screens.

The reference interfaces have imperfections too: unresolved logos, stale profile identity, deposit/dock overlap and long provider waits. Improve these as declared adaptations. Preserve the intended information and journey, not the accidental defect.
