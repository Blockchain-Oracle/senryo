# Logos, asset identity and the small details that make this feel designed

[Study index](README.md) · [Feature inventory](09-feature-inventory.md) · [Redesign opportunities](10-redesign-opportunities.md) · [Structured identity register](asset-identity-register.json)

**Known assets, networks, companies and providers need their actual marks or artwork.** BTC gets the Bitcoin mark; USDC gets the USDC mark; a chain gets its recognizable chain identity; an exchange gets its own logo. A dollar glyph, generic coin, letter in a colored circle or component-library icon does not satisfy that requirement. This applies across discovery, detail, selectors, funding, order entry, activity and shareable output wherever that identity is present.

The recordings use identity as part of composition, not a decorative afterthought: logos orbit Phantom's character, sit around Solflare's trading mockup, occupy Fomo's network rows, and overlap asset discs as contextual badges. Merchant images, company marks, token artwork and human avatars provide variety that one generic icon family cannot.

![28 inspected identity crops with source IDs and times](evidence/identity-board.jpg)

These are **screen-recording evidence crops**, including dimmed and unresolved image states. They are not transparent originals, licensed production assets, or a verified current brand kit. The register contains 38 identity/artwork entries; some group related visible artwork and some document a missing asset or target design gap. Source timestamps are in [screen-index.json](screen-index.json).

## Distinguish the identities before selecting artwork

| Role | What belongs there | Recorded example | Frequent fidelity mistake |
|---|---|---|---|
| Asset | Canonical token artwork/mark and instrument label | BTC, SOL, USDC, USDT, ZEC, PENGU | Giving every row the same coin or dollar icon |
| Network | Chain mark plus explicit network/environment text | Monad, Base, Solana Devnet | Assuming token symbol alone identifies the receiving network |
| Venue/context | Actual venue or contextual mark, separate from asset | Small Hyperliquid-like mark attached to ZEC | Replacing the ZEC logo with the venue mark, or treating any badge as a chain |
| Underlying company | Company artwork with the actual instrument type retained | AAPLx, GOOGLX, TSLA | Showing company branding while dropping the tokenized/perp distinction |
| Provider | Named auth/payment/exchange provider and correct logo variant | Google, Apple, Apple Pay, Coinbase | Using a generic person, card, bank or wallet glyph as the provider identity |
| Person/group | Actual avatar or authored default identity | Trader faces, Fomo profile avatar, clan cards | Repeating one stock user silhouette across all people |
| Status | Meaningful check, rank, Open, New or leverage badge | Blue token checks; 10x; rank medals | Presenting a check as a network logo or as independently proven verification |
| Action | A readable functional icon | Search, star, share, back, close, info | Forcing a brand logo into a utility control |
| Illustration | Authored scene/object with a clear purpose | Piggy bank, mirror, ghost, shield, flag | Replacing all artwork with component-library symbols |

Generic **action** icons are appropriate. They must not stand in for an identifiable entity. Cartoon content can contain a generic chart arrow, chat bubble or sports ball: those objects are illustration layers, not missing asset logos.

## Exact observations and corrections

1. **Fomo's network picker uses monochrome brand silhouettes.** [F21](evidence/R3/screens/F21.jpg) places the chain name on the left and a small white chain mark on the right. Solana stripes, Base's square, BNB's cube, Monad's hollow tilted form, Robinhood's feather, Arc's arch and Ethereum's diamond remain recognizable. Authentic identity does not mean every surface must use a full-color disc.
2. **The Apple Pay token picker has blue check badges.** [F22](evidence/R3/screens/F22.jpg) shows PENGU, TRUMP, PEPE, WIF and other actual token artwork, with blue scalloped checks at the lower right. Their meaning/verification authority is not established. They are not chain logos. The earlier Fomo timeline description has been corrected.
3. **ZEC has two separate identities.** [F32](evidence/R3/screens/F32.jpg) has the large gold/black Zcash mark and a small mint mark matching the shape of the Hyperliquid row in F21. The blue 10x chip is a third, textual risk/market-limit badge. Keep all three roles distinct; the footage does not establish the underlying venue/network data model.
4. **Some token images genuinely remain unresolved in the retained frame.** [S27](evidence/R1/screens/S27.jpg) has loaded SOL/USDC/USDT marks alongside blank white discs for other rows. The cause could be loading, failed fetch or absent metadata. Record that honestly; it does not make blank discs the preferred final design. S24, by comparison, has recognizable marks throughout its chain list.
5. **Provider variants depend on their surface.** Phantom uses black Apple and Google marks on lavender pills; Solflare shows a multicolor Google G on its light social button. Do not force every Google mark to multicolor, or tint every mark to the app's accent. Obtain an appropriate authentic variant and verify usage before implementation.
6. **Company identity and account-provider identity are different contexts.** Apple's mark appears in the AAPLx illustration; Google appears as GOOGLX/GOOGL artwork. Their authentication buttons and Apple Pay payment wordmark have separate jobs. Naming and labels must distinguish those jobs.
7. **Payment artwork carries real network identity.** [S05](evidence/R1/screens/S05.jpg) integrates the Solflare wordmark and red/yellow Mastercard circles into the black card. The reflective object beside it is a freestanding circular mirror with a stand. These details should be described as actual objects, not “a shiny blob.” They do not establish Senryo's card network or issuance capabilities.
8. **Identity continues beyond token rows.** [S19](evidence/R1/screens/S19.jpg) has NordVPN benefit artwork, organization avatars and a branded promotion. [F28](evidence/R3/screens/F28.jpg) uses Cash App, Coinbase and Binance marks. [F29](evidence/R3/screens/F29.jpg) combines human avatars with small asset clusters and rank badges.

## Asset-delivery contract for an implementation agent

Maintain a registry keyed by **the actual entity**, not just a display ticker. A token key should include the relevant network and canonical contract/mint or authoritative native-asset ID; a perp should retain its venue and market ID. Similar tickers and company-associated instruments must not accidentally share unrelated artwork.

For every known entity, record:

- Entity ID, display name/symbol, role, instrument type and network/venue where applicable.
- Source URL or supplied asset location, provenance, usage/permission information, retrieval date and file hash.
- Actual image/vector paths and supported variants: full color, light/dark monochrome where appropriate, wordmark versus symbol, disc versus uncontained mark.
- View box/aspect ratio, optical-size treatment, transparent background, padding and contrast surface. Preserve the mark's shape; do not stretch it to fill a square.
- Primary artwork, secondary contextual badge and separately modelled status badges. Do not paint a venue or check into the main asset file if it needs to change independently.
- Loading, failed fetch and genuinely unidentified states. Keep readable identity text. A neutral labelled fallback can identify missing artwork without pretending to be the official logo.

Acquire production artwork from the entity's first-party brand resources or authoritative token/instrument metadata and check it against the entity being shown. Screenshots, remembered logo shapes, a search result thumbnail or a generated approximation are not production provenance. No external logo downloads or brand-permission checks were performed in this reference study.

Known artwork should resolve consistently across market row → detail → ticket → review → activity. Preserve each surface's intended scale and layering rather than forcing one oversized disc everywhere. Small logos require optical checks at actual mobile size; a technically correct SVG can still become unreadable if the padding or contrast is wrong.

## Senryo implications verified in this workspace

[marks.ts](../../../packages/tokens/src/marks.ts) defines theme-independent identity **colors**. A color map is useful but does not supply the actual artwork. [EngineMarketRow](../../../apps/mobile/src/features/markets/MarketRow.tsx) currently renders text identity, venue/session/leverage, sparkline and price data without rendering an asset image in that component. These are focused source observations, not a claim that the entire app has no logos or that any UI has been visually audited here.

The adaptation should add actual identity artwork to the relevant journeys while preserving the approved D2 system. BTC orange and USDC blue should not become gold simply because the surrounding Senryo surface uses gold. Where a monochrome identity is appropriate, use a legitimate variant with its silhouette intact. Changes to surrounding card, glow, rim, paper/lacquer and artwork materials can provide the creative color expression.

Gold, silver and FX need a different treatment from issued coins. **XAU commodity exposure is not Tether Gold**, and XAG has no universal issuer logo. Define original, consistent commodity artwork and explicit instrument labels rather than borrowing an unrelated token's identity. AUSD, USDC, supported chains and venue integrations need their own authentic marks when those actual entities are shown. This study has not delivered or authenticated those target production assets.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every known displayed asset/network/provider resolves to the correct actual mark or artwork. No generic coin, dollar, hexagon or app-accent initial silently passes as a known entity.
- The identity remains correct through the full journey, including modal selectors, risk inputs, loading recovery and receipts.
- Asset, chain, venue and verification/status badges are correctly distinguished and legible at actual viewport size.
- Label, symbol, artwork and network/venue are bound to the same record. Contract/mint identity matters when tickers collide.
- Dark/light surfaces and reduced-motion mode retain readable identity; color alone is insufficient to distinguish networks.
- Share/card output retains actual instrument identity and honest product mode/status. Competitor card brands, rewards and support lists cannot become target capabilities through decoration.
